This folder contains the default Seurat processing of colorectal tumors and adjacent normal tissues presented in "Spatially organized multicellular immune hubs in human colorectal cancer" by Pelka et al. (2021) [doi:  10.1016/j.cell.2021.08.003 ]. The raw counts were downloaded from the GEO with ascension ID GSE178341. Data from Broad Institute's Single Cell Portal has normalized the count in matrix each entry by some unkown procedure, so we do not use that. A tsv of cell-type annotations is however downloaded from the Single Cell Portal.

Patients C108 and C117 are excldued from the original study due to concurrent hematologic neoplasms, and their data is not provided; this leaves 62 patients. There are 100 samples, of which 35 are  mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) tumors which exhibit more anit-tumor immunity than 29 samples mismatch repair-proficient (MMRp) tumors. MMRd subject C130 and MMRp subject C171 both have a single replication. For comparison are 36 adjacent healthy tissues. We remove 1 tumor sample with less than 50 cells.

The GEO data contains 370,115 cells, 1,108 fewer than in the Broad data, and 43,113 genes, 162 fewer. The data appears to have already been quality controlled; each cell matches the minimum number of features thereshold and the metadata QC metrics match mitochondrial filtering, both described on page e6 of the paper. It is not clear whether the UMI outlier filtering steps were applied; however it seems likely because other statistics included in the QC table with documented cutoffs from the paper have those cutoffs applied, e.g. doublet p-values less than 1e-4. 

After adding an additional filtering step to only keep genes appearing in at least 10 cells, 28,951 genes remain. The original paper uses NMF to select a subset of 1000 to 8000 genes "within each experimental batch (i.e., 10x channel)." The parenthetical refers to samples which were sequenced using both 10X V2 and V3 solution. Two samples from one patient (C162_T and C162_N) are the only sequenced with both V2 and V3. These doubly sequenced samples may be of independent interest, but for our default processing we only use the V3 samples because that is newer technology. We note that both sequencing sites used both technologies, so this is a separate batch effect. The final object contains 359,318 cells.
